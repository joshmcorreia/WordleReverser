# WordleReverser

## Purpose:
Many people use the same starting word every day when playing Wordle. WordleReverser helps you determine that word. This will not work when people use different words every day.

This project doesn't have a particularly useful real-world application, it's just a fun side project that I thought of.

**DISCLAIMER:** This may ruin part of the challenge of Wordle for you, so user discretion is advised.

## How to use it:
1. Paste your friend's solutions into the `input.txt` file (both emojis and their text counterparts are acceptable)
2. Add the word of the day right below the solution (there are examples already in `input.txt`)
3. Open up a terminal and type `python3 reverser.py`
4. You'll get an output similar to the following:
```
